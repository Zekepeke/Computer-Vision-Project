# Computer Vision Project

A project for gesture recognition using Mediapipe, OpenCV, and neural networks. This repository includes scripts for live video hand gesture recognition and tools for training a model on custom gestures.

---

## Features
- **Live Gesture Recognition**: Use `mediapipeLive.py` for real-time hand gesture detection.
- **Custom Gesture Training**: Train a neural network on labeled gesture videos using Mediapipe.
